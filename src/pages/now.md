Hi! I'm Gustavo Salvini.

- Creating **Matriz20en1**, an AI-powered tool for business analysis models.
- Advancing **TinkerCalc**, a personal project for a multi-field technical calculator for engineers, developers, and scientists.
- Growing my consulting practice through **EcimTech**, focusing on custom web solutions and WordPress-based projects with high SEO and security standards.

## 🧠 Researching

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**:  
  - Integrating APIs from **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Gemini**.
  - Exploring **open-source LLMs** and **local deployments** for privacy-focused projects.
  - Investigating **RAG systems** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and **semantic search** technologies for smarter information retrieval inside apps.
- **Advanced State Management** for React apps:  
  - Deep diving into **Zustand**, **MobX State Tree**, and **Valtio** patterns.
- Experimenting with **AI-augmented development workflows**:  
  Using AI to boost coding, architecture design, and product ideation processes.

## ✍️ Writing

- Launching this new blog as a way to **share my journey**, **document learning**, and **collaborate** with others.
