# Introduction

**Technology has always amplified our abilities —for better and for worse— extending the reach of our hands, our thoughts and our dreams. For a long time, this idea was profoundly inspiring, even transcendent, delving into the profound essence of what makes us human.**

**Lately, beneath the rapid currents of progress, I've been feeling a growing unease. As we advance, our tools develop faster and smarter, but this progress comes at the steep cost of losing something infinitely more precious: something delicate and profoundly human.**

I've been a software developer and tech tinkerer for over three decades. For me, this isn't abstract philosophy, it's deeply personal. Creating solutions has always been about the journey, not just the destination, countless hours have gone into collaborating with others, discussing ideas, and turning those ideas into tangible tools and interfaces that genuinely improve lives. It's the human interactions along the way —discussions, disagreements, and moments of shared triumph— that give **meaning** to the work.

## Scale and Presence

Generative tools are not inherently negative. We can use them and evolve with them. Still, it's worth taking a moment to reflect on what we genuinely gain when we create together —as people, not just as individuals collaborating with machines—. When we build things side by side, as we did in the ironically termed *old times*, which, in reality, were just yesterday.

Yes, we could scale tremendously embracing the incredible acceleration that technology offers. **But scaling should mean involving more people, not fewer.** There are human dimensions no machine can fully grasp, and we risk losing something essential if we exclude people from the process.

There are aspects of reality that remain non-deterministic, non-computable, and fundamentally human, as beautifully captured by Gödel's incompleteness theorem, which reminds us that no formal system can fully explain itself, and exemplified by numerous natural phenomena that remain unsolvable by AI. **These limits are not flaws: they are reminders that there will always be truths, insights, and experiences that only human presence and intuition can reach.**

## Companionship

Equally important have been the numerous hours spent with colleagues, initially strangers who soon became trusted companions. **Our shared passion for learning, teaching, and creating genuine value from technology formed bonds that have lasted.**

Remarkably, with many of these colleagues —some friendships spanning over thirty years— I continue to collaborate, driven by our mutual passion for creating with a human touch, infusing our work with personal connections and meaningful interactions.

Over time, these collaborations have become more than just professional. Together, we've built support networks —recommending each other, sharing opportunities, and being there in difficult moments. We've lifted each other up not just as professionals, but as people. And in that mutual support, we've discovered a quiet, enduring strength.

We are stronger together, not in the same way algorithms become faster or more efficient, but in a human sense. In resilience, empathy, creativity, and connection. Algorithms and humans are not competitors. They're complementary. Machines might enhance output, but only people can build meaning through relationships and care.

# The Vanishing Craft

The craft of creation has always meant more to me than the final outcome. Those late nights wrestling with code, relentless debugging marathons, and the quiet, joyful victories — these defined our **pride**. It was a profound feeling, understood only by those who truly create, captured simply in: **We made this**.

Yet now, things are changing profoundly, and I wonder if people today can truly experience that same **pride** in creations that are increasingly **generated** rather than personally crafted. The very essence of our craft —the act of creation itself— is undergoing a profound transformation, and I wonder if we truly comprehend the depth of this change and what it signifies for us as human beings.

# The Promise and the Void

We're living through an explosion of generative AI. Images, texts, code, voice, music — all conjured up with a prompt and a click. At first, I was fascinated. Then skeptical. Now, I'm deeply reflective.

Yes, AI can help. Yes, it can speed up our work, bring inspiration, reduce repetitive tasks. But I keep asking myself: **where are we going when most of what we see, hear, and read is no longer made by a person — but "generated"?**

What happens when creation becomes frictionless?

What happens to **pride**?

What happens to the meaning we assign to the things we build, if they were never the result of our effort, our imperfections, our process?

# The Human Dimension

**I'm a father now. And that changes everything.** I'm also a husband, a son, and a friend. I do my best to be present for the people I love, even when the demands of my calendar suggest otherwise.

Each day, I navigate the rich and often paradoxical complexity of life: solving problems, modeling software solutions, writing code, refining my business models, seeking new clients, exploring partnerships, and uncovering meaningful opportunities and good deals. In parallel, I offer comfort, change nappies, share affection, and hold space for those I care about, balancing the responsibilities of work and love with attention and intention. And in parallel, I comfort, care, play, listen, and hold space for the people who share my life.

**Like many of us, I carry lives within my life**: interwoven threads of care, responsibility, and presence. And in this rich tapestry, the depth of human connection far outweighs the sterile logic of any algorithm. **Our value isn't measured in compute power or memory windows, but in our ability to be there for each other, to create meaning not just through action, but through intention, attention, and care.**

And I believe that's the essence of it all.

**We are not just minds processing data: we are warmth, connection, and presence. We are stories woven into each other's lives, not just nodes in a network.**

This is why I build. This is why I consult. Not to follow fleeting trends or to optimize productivity at all costs, but to serve real people. To build things that honor time, balance, family, friends, and the quiet dignity of effort. To recognize those who live by ideals, who pursue honorable and altruistic goals, **not for acclaim, but out of a deep sense of purpose and connection to others.**

> **To scale as humans is not to compute faster or store more context: it is to deepen the bonds that make us human.** 
> 
> To cultivate the sparks of genius and intuition that emerge from trust, empathy, and shared purpose. While machines operate in tokens and gigabytes, we navigate mystery, guided by serendipity and drawn into the immeasurable, poetic dimensions of being alive. That's something no model, no algorithm, no protocol can replace.

# The Role of a Software Developer Today

I no longer see my role as simply keeping up with the latest framework, writing elegant code, or chasing the next tech craze. Those things have their place, but I tend to believe our work, as developers, technologists, and creators, carries a deeper purpose. I'd say it's about preserving meaning, about keeping human intention alive in every app, every service, and every bit of automation we bring into people's lives.

**I don't believe AI has arrived to take our jobs. But I do wonder what might happen if we keep moving forward without reflecting. Without conversation. The real risk isn't just being replaced: it's that something far more important might quietly vanish: the human presence, the values, and the unique dimensions we bring to our craft.**

These human dimensions —ideals, serendipities, the spark of genius and joy we find along the way— aren't just hard to replicate. They can't be replicated. If we let convenience guide everything, we might find ourselves in a world where only the dimensions that generative tools can simulate are left. No more slow breakthroughs. No more unexpected twists. No more pride in the messiness of creation or the beauty of persistence. **Just fast dopamine, and cold results.**

That's a direction I believe is worth questioning.

Personally, I'd prefer to see more open conversations, not just about AI performance or the latest product releases, but about ethics, about how technology shapes our relationships, our attention, and our sense of meaning.

Because if we don't ask these questions, I wonder: **who will?**

# This Is Not Technophobia

**Don't get me wrong: I use AI.** I explore it, I build with it, and I even help others bring it into their work and businesses. But I try to approach it the way one might approach fire: with respect, curiosity, and caution.

The challenge, in my view, isn't the technology itself. It's the uncritical enthusiasm, the tendency to follow it blindly without asking what we might be giving up along the way.

If we don't take a moment to reflect on the trade-offs, we might someday find ourselves surrounded by endless content, automated responses, and perfectly optimized systems, but disconnected from what makes creation meaningful. We could end up with no real connection, no sense of effort, no pride in what we've made: just cold, efficient results, and the fleeting hit of fast dopamine.

## The Craft Must Evolve, But Not Disappear

Craft is not just about slowness. It's about *presence*. **It's about pouring yourself into something and recognizing yourself in the result.** Whether it's a blog post like this, a line of code, a letter, a song: the pride comes from *making*.

So here's a question I leave you with — whether you're a developer, a manager, an artist, or a parent:

> Will you still be proud of what you made, if you never really made it?

# One Last Thought

I don't believe we need to reject AI, nor turn away from the tools shaping our time. But I do feel there's something precious we might want to hold close: **our humanity**, in the way we work, create, love, and share.

The future, after all, won't be shaped by technology alone. It will be shaped by the intentions we carry into it, the values we embed, the care we offer, and the meaning we choose to preserve. And maybe just as important, by the pace we choose to live and create at.

**Because life doesn't have to be fast to be meaningful.** The joy of human-made things often lies in the care, the time, and the presence poured into them. There's quiet pride in making something slowly but purposefully. In choosing depth over speed. In valuing process as much as outcome. In embracing purposeful work, even if it isn't perfect.

If there's one hope I keep returning to, it's that we continue to shape our tools without letting them reshape what makes us human. That we keep finding ways to build not just efficiently, but beautifully. Not just faster, but more meaningfully. Not just usable, but unforgettable.

And maybe, as we look ahead, the most meaningful thing we'll bring into the future is not just our knowledge or efficiency, but our presence. Our ability to care. To notice. To make meaning, not just output.

Not perfect but present. And profoundly human.

This is just the beginning of an ongoing reflection. In future posts, I'll keep exploring how we can navigate this evolving digital age while preserving what makes us deeply human — our connections, our creativity, our pride in what we craft with care.

Thanks for reading!
