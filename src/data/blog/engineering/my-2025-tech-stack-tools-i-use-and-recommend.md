Technology evolves fast. Staying ahead means constantly learning, experimenting, and adjusting the tools you rely on.

Here's a snapshot of my **current 2025 tech stack** — the technologies I use daily to build web applications, design scalable architectures, and integrate AI into real-world solutions.

## Web Development Core

### Frontend: React Ecosystem

- **React**\
  Still the heart of modern frontend development.\
  I focus heavily on **modular architectures**, **component-driven design**, and **state isolation**.

- **Next.js**\
  My go-to framework for production-grade applications.\
  I leverage:
  - **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for performance.
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** when needed for SEO or dynamic content.
  - **API Routes** and **Edge Functions** for lightweight serverless backend logic.
  - **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** for hybrid flexibility.

- **Astro**\
  A refreshing new approach for content-driven websites and hybrid applications.\
  I use Astro when:
  - I want **maximum performance** with minimal JavaScript shipped to the client.
  - I'm building **static-first** sites that still need islands of interactivity via **React**, **Vue**, or **Svelte** components.
  - SEO and load times are critical.

- **Vite** (for React SPAs)\
  For projects that don't require a full Next.js stack, I use Vite for **blazing-fast development** and **optimized builds**.

### UI Frameworks and Component Libraries

- **Mantine UI**\
  My favorite choice for fast, elegant, and highly customizable UIs.

- **Chakra UI**\
  Excellent for accessibility-focused projects and when building with a design system in mind.

- **Radix UI**\
  Low-level, unstyled primitives for building headless components when I need full control.

## State Management: Advanced Strategies

### Libraries I Use

- **Zustand**\
  Lightweight, minimal boilerplate, and perfect for modular state slices. I use it heavily, often combined with Immer.

- **MobX and MobX State Tree (MST)**\
  For more structured, complex apps where data trees and actions are essential.

- **Valtio**\
  Proxy-based reactivity for simpler apps with direct state mutation patterns.

- **Immer**\
  Always part of the toolkit for managing immutable state updates efficiently.

## AI & LLMs Integration

One of my most exciting focus areas right now is the **integration of AI into web solutions**.\
Here's the stack I'm working with:

### APIs and Models

- **OpenAI**\
  Core API integrations for chat, completions, embeddings, and fine-tuned models.

- **Anthropic (Claude)**\
  Powerful alternative for safer, more context-aware interactions.

- **Gemini (Google DeepMind)**\
  Useful for creative tasks and multimodal experiments.

- **Ollama** (for local models)\
  When privacy or data residency matters, I explore local LLM deployments.

### Technologies Around LLMs

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems**\
  Enhancing LLMs by connecting them with live external data sources, documents, and custom indexes.

- **Vector Databases**\
  Experimenting with **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, and lightweight local options for semantic search integrations.

- **LangChain**\
  For chaining LLM prompts, APIs, and external data into coherent applications and workflows.

- **Embeddings**\
  Using OpenAI Embeddings, HuggingFace Sentence Transformers, and custom-trained vectors for smarter semantic search.

### Privacy-Centric AI

I'm actively researching **local LLM deployments** and **edge-based inference** to build privacy-respecting solutions, especially for future business tools and internal apps.

## Backend and API Layer

- **REST APIs** and **GraphQL** integrations.
- **Headless CMS** for content management when needed.
- **Serverless functions** (Vercel, AWS Lambda) for lightweight backend logic.

## Observability and DevOps

- **DigitalOcean** VPS + Docker\
  For more customized server setups when needed.

- **Vercel**\
  Fast and reliable deployment of modern frontend apps.

- **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite**\
  Reliable choices for relational databases, depending on the project scale.

- **Prisma and Drizzle ORM**\
  Clean, type-safe database access for Node.js projects.

## Final Thoughts

In 2025, **the tech stack is not just about which tools you use, but how you combine them creatively** to solve real-world problems.

For me, it's about:
- Staying agile.
- Prioritizing performance and scalability.
- Integrating AI intelligently where it **amplifies user experience and development productivity**.

I'll keep evolving this stack and I'll keep sharing the journey.

Thanks for reading!
