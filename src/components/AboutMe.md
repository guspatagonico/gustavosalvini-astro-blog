I'm a Software Developer and IT Consultant, passionate about building technology that drives growth, unlocks new opportunities, and creates a better quality of life â€” because innovation means nothing if it doesn't respect our time, our families, and our lives beyond work.

Here, I share ideas, insights, and projects that reflect my approach: building with purpose, solving with creativity, and learning together along the way. I believe the best outcomes emerge through collaboration and a deep understanding of technology's real impact.
